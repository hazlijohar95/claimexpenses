## 🔥 Key Optimizations Implemented

### **1. Architecture Improvements**
```typescript
// Lazy loading for better performance
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));

// Constants for maintainability
export const APP_CONFIG = {
  NAME: 'Cynclaim',
  COMPANY: 'Cynco',
  VERSION: '1.0.0',
} as const;

// Security utilities
export const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter();
export const validateEmail = (email: string): boolean => { ... };
```

### **2. Security Enhancements**
```typescript
// Rate limiting
if (!rateLimiter.isAllowed(`signin_${email}`, 5, 15 * 60 * 1000)) {
  throw new Error('Too many attempts');
}

// Input sanitization
export const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '');
};
```

### **3. Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Memoized callbacks
const signIn = useCallback(async (email: string, password: string) => {
  // Implementation
}, []);

// Suspense boundaries
<Suspense fallback={<SuspenseFallback />}>
  <Routes>...</Routes>
</Suspense>
```

### **4. UI/UX Refinements**
```css
/* v0.dev inspired design system */
.btn-primary {
  @apply bg-black text-white font-medium py-2.5 px-4 rounded-lg 
         transition-all duration-200 hover:bg-gray-800;
}

/* Consistent spacing */
.space-y-8 > * + * { margin-top: 2rem; }
```
